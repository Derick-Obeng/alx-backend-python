## üö¶ Repository Highlights

**Generators**  
*Efficient iteration and lazy evaluation made easy.*  
Explore Python's generators: learn how to use `yield`, build generator expressions, and process large datasets efficiently.

**Decorators**  
*Meta-programming for clean, reusable code.*  
Discover how decorators allow you to wrap, extend, and modify function behavior elegantly.

**Context Managers & Async Operations**  
*Resource management and concurrency in Python.*  
Master the `with` statement, custom context managers, and get started with `async`/`await` for non-blocking code.

**Testing**  
*Write robust code with confidence.*  
Dive into unit and integration testing: structure tests, mock behaviors, and ensure your code works as expected.

**Django Middleware**  
*Intercept and shape HTTP requests and responses.*  
Build custom middleware to add features or enforce logic at the core of Django's request/response cycle.

**Django Signals & ORM**  
*React to events and manage data the Django way.*  
Harness Django's signals to automate workflows and use the ORM for high-level database operations.

**Messaging App**  
*Bring it all together in a real project.*  
A practical messaging app that showcases how these backend concepts work in a real-world application.
